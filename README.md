# NEMO + Network
National Electricity Market Optimiser
Fork by Luke Marshall

This is a fork of Dr. Ben Elliston's National Electricity Market Optimiser. It is intended to incorporate a graph model of Australia's electricity network.

The Graph model is from my nem-competition-model project at https://github.com/lukasmarshall/nem-competition-model.

This is not production code - for users looking for NEMO visit Ben's repository at https://github.com/bje-/NEMO
